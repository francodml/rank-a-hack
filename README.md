# Rank-A-Hack(athon)
A small project designed to cover a full-stack webapp implementation.
The stack is based around React and Redux for the frontend, and Express and mongoose for backend and database handling.
Test data is generated via [hack-a-rank-datagen](https://github.com/francodml/hack-a-rank-datagen) using faker and sent as POST requests to the API endpoints on the backend.
